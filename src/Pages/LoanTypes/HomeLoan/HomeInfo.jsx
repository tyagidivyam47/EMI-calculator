        <p>
          You will not pay property taxes and home insurance premium each month,
          but it is included in the total monthly payment with the assumption
          that you are setting aside this amount (either through Recurring
          Deposit or some other means) every month. This will ensure that you
          will have the necessary money to make the payment once or twice a
          year. Please note that the recurring expenses will change over the
          lifetime of the home loan due to inflation and other factors. They
          will also continue beyond the home loan tenure.
